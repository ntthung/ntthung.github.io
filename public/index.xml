      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.</description>

      <description>Should we have the blue
For temperatures, volcanoes,
Teleconnections
And hydroclimate too?
Higher temperature, denser wood
I thought this was understood
But wait, it may be diverging
And challenge our understanding.
And there in the tropics
Warm often and seasonally humid
To see all the control factors
You may add hydro to the mix.
Tambora erupted
A decade the blue interrupted.
Should we have the blue?
I think so, do you?</description>

      <description>The Mekong is mighty, the Mekong is dammed
The Mekong is flooded in the dry season
Is it by nature, or is it caused by dams?
“It’s the dams!”, said the trees
“For I haven’t seen anything like that
In almost three centuries”.
“It’s true!”, said the model
“For what you see is not natural
It’s a half time more than normal”.
The cycle has changed
The delicate balance hangs</description>

      <description>What goes up must come down
What comes down may flow out
Overland,
Subsurface,
And seepage
To rivers all around.
Let the rain infiltrate.
An impervious surface
Is an open flood gate
Like soil after drought
Forests doused with flames.
Rivers are too warm
Waters are too rich
Oxygen devoured.
The flow of water
The flow of nature
Let our water flow
Let our nature grow.</description>

      <title>Why the 2022 Po River Drought Is the Worst in the Past Two Centuries
</title>

      <description>The causes of recent hydrological droughts and their future evolution under a changing climate are still poorly understood. Banking on a 216-year river flow time series at the Po River outlet, we show that the 2022 hydrological drought is the worst event (30% lower than the second worst, with a six-century return period), part of an increasing trend in severe drought occurrence. The decline in summer river flows (−4.14 cubic meters per second per year), which is more relevant than the precipitation decline, is attributed to a combination of changes in the precipitation regime, resulting in a decline of snow fraction (−0.</description>

      <description>Longleaf pines have not only long leaves, but also long lives. Thus they are excellent materials to build tree-ring time machines. Grant Hartley led a ginormous effort to review everything longleaf in this paper. I was lucky to contribute a teeny bit.
I also got to learn how such a big project is executed. In the old days this would have been a monograph by a gentleman scientist. Science is more inclusive now, and a diverse team of authors work on this project together.</description>

      <title>Increasing Drought Risks Over the Past Four Centuries Amidst Projected Flood Intensification in the Kabul River Basin (Afghanistan and Pakistan)—Evidence From Tree Rings</title>

      <description>The Kabul River is a transboundary river spanning eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. It is an important tributary of the Indus, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest rivers with intensive water withdrawals for human use. With climate change, the Kabul River is projected to have more frequent and larger floods, but the projections are very uncertain. To have a better understanding of these future projections, we need to look at how the region&amp;rsquo;s climate has changed in the past.</description>

      <description>Such devastation
When the rivers swell
And land inundated
Will this be our fate
Mighty trees, do tell!
(And the trees answered)
Floods you must worry
But lest you forget
Droughts are getting worse
In four centuries.
A stronger water cycle
Could mean more troubles:
Frequent floods and droughts!
More tree ring records
Less water hurdle.</description>

      <description>Long records of river discharge, reconstructed from tree rings, help us understand how rivers behaved in response to past climates, and place projected climate changes in a broader perspective. While this knowledge is valuable, streamflow reconstructions have rarely been used to directly inform water management models, because tree rings are annual while water system models require streamflow data of higher resolutions, such as monthly or weekly. In our study, we use a rich network of tree ring data, consisting of both ring widths and stable oxygen isotope ratios, to reconstruct monthly river discharge at four key gauging stations that represent the four main tributaries of the Chao Phraya River, Thailand, thus bridging the gap between tree rings and water management.</description>

      <description>Summary The Kabul River is a transboundary river spanning eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. It is an important tributary of the Indus, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest rivers with intensive water withdrawals for human use. With climate change, the Kabul River is projected to have more frequent and larger floods, but the projections are very uncertain. To have a better understanding of these future projections, we need to look at how the region&amp;rsquo;s climate has changed in the past.</description>

      <description>Motivations &amp;amp; Objectives Tree rings, with annual resolution and precise dating, can provide temporally high-resolution proxy records of past climate. However, annually-resolved tree ring data still restrict how tree-ring-based paleoclimate reconstructions can be used in subsequent applications, where finer resolutions are desirable. For example, it is often difficult to compare annual climate reconstructions against historical events, because an event may have happened outside the target season of the reconstruction, or two opposite events (a flood and a drought) may be smoothed out by a reconstruction that targets the annual average (Wise, 2021).</description>

      <description>Forest, forest, what are thee?
I am part hydrology
Look around, it&amp;rsquo;s all water
Above, below, and within me.
I intercept water with my canopy
and with my litter of leaves.
I transpire as I photosynthesize
Less moisture recycled without me.
I carry rings that hold stories
Kept within my ancient trees.
I am your past and your future
So study me and protect me.</description>

      <description>I am all for
Tree ring cores
One year, one number
How do we get more?
Take ring width and δ18O from some species
With different seasonal sensitivities
Combine them with mass balance regression
And we can have streamflow, monthly
(with long term intra-annual variability)
There are still challenges as we speak
The dry months, the wet years, the years with multiple peaks
But we have BI, and methods that are nonlinear</description>

      <description>Long history of river discharge, or streamflow, can be reconstructed from tree rings. These reconstructions help us understand the water cycle in the past, but they have not been widely used in water resources operations. This is because reconstructions are often annual (having only one data point per year). By combining different tree species and different features of tree rings (for example, ring width and stable isotope ratio), it is possible to reconstruct seasonal streamflow in addition to the annual one, and that is our first goal.</description>

Rmarkdown In .Rmarkdown documents, you can use either
$a \ne 0$ to get inline math: \(a \ne 0\). There is no conflict with using dollar symbols regularly, because knitr automatically escapes freestanding dollar symbols.
And you can use
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ to get a math paragraph:
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.</description>

To manage these critical resources, we need a better understanding of river discharge—how does it change over a long time? Are there common variation patterns among rivers? To answer these questions, we use information derived from tree rings to reconstruct average annual river discharge history at 62 gauges in 16 Asian countries.</description>

      <description>The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of global hydro-climatic variability, with well-known effects on floods, droughts, and coupled human-natural systems. Its impact on urban settlements depends on both level of exposure and preparedness; two factors that are responsible for severe cuts on millions of people in developing countries, where urban water supply relies almost entirely on rainfall-dependent sources. To understand whether information on the ENSO state could help mitigate the effects of droughts, we use Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s water supply system as exemplifying case study, for which we design “traditional” and adaptive management policies.</description>

      <title>A Linear Dynamical Systems Approach to Streamflow Reconstruction Reveals History of Regime Shifts in Northern Thailand

      <description>Streamflow reconstruction involves estimating streamflow volumes in the distant past using statistical techniques and long range climate proxies. Conventionally, this is done using linear regression techniques which model streamflow as a linear function of climatic inputs. These models do not consider catchment dynamics, although in reality, streamflow volume depends on both climatic inputs and the state of the catchment (whether it is wet or dry). Here, we contribute a novel reconstruction technique, based on linear dynamical systems, that models explicitly the catchment state and its interaction with climatic inputs.</description>
