      <description>Longleaf pines have not only long leaves, but also long lives. Thus they are excellent materials to build tree-ring time machines. Grant Hartley led a ginormous effort to review everything longleaf in this paper. I was lucky to contribute a teeny bit.
I also got to learn how such a big project is executed. In the old days this would have been a monograph by a gentleman scientist. Science is more inclusive now, and a diverse team of authors work on this project together.</description>

      <title>Increasing Drought Risks Over the Past Four Centuries Amidst Projected Flood Intensification in the Kabul River Basin (Afghanistan and Pakistan)—Evidence From Tree Rings</title>

      <description>The Kabul River is a transboundary river spanning eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. It is an important tributary of the Indus, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest rivers with intensive water withdrawals for human use. With climate change, the Kabul River is projected to have more frequent and larger floods, but the projections are very uncertain. To have a better understanding of these future projections, we need to look at how the region&amp;rsquo;s climate has changed in the past.</description>

      <title>Droughts, Pluvials, and Wet Season Timing Across the Chao Phraya River Basin: A 254-Year Monthly Reconstruction From Tree Ring Widths and &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O

      <description>Long records of river discharge, reconstructed from tree rings, help us understand how rivers behaved in response to past climates, and place projected climate changes in a broader perspective. While this knowledge is valuable, streamflow reconstructions have rarely been used to directly inform water management models, because tree rings are annual while water system models require streamflow data of higher resolutions, such as monthly or weekly. In our study, we use a rich network of tree ring data, consisting of both ring widths and stable oxygen isotope ratios, to reconstruct monthly river discharge at four key gauging stations that represent the four main tributaries of the Chao Phraya River, Thailand, thus bridging the gap between tree rings and water management.</description>

      <title>Multi‐Proxy, Multi‐Season Streamflow Reconstruction with Mass Balance Adjustment
</title>

      <description>Long history of river discharge, or streamflow, can be reconstructed from tree rings. These reconstructions help us understand the water cycle in the past, but they have not been widely used in water resources operations. This is because reconstructions are often annual (having only one data point per year). By combining different tree species and different features of tree rings (for example, ring width and stable isotope ratio), it is possible to reconstruct seasonal streamflow in addition to the annual one, and that is our first goal.</description>

      <title>Coherent Streamflow Variability in Monsoon Asia Over the Past Eight Centuries—Links to Oceanic Drivers
</title>

      <description>Ten of the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest rivers are located entirely within the Asian Monsoon region. They provide water, energy, and food for 1.7 billion people. To manage these critical resources, we need a better understanding of river discharge—how does it change over a long time? Are there common variation patterns among rivers? To answer these questions, we use information derived from tree rings to reconstruct average annual river discharge history at 62 gauges in 16 Asian countries.</description>

      <title>On the Value of ENSO State for Urban Water Supply System Operators: Opportunities, Trade-Offs, and Challenges
</title>

      <description>The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of global hydro-climatic variability, with well-known effects on floods, droughts, and coupled human-natural systems. Its impact on urban settlements depends on both level of exposure and preparedness; two factors that are responsible for severe cuts on millions of people in developing countries, where urban water supply relies almost entirely on rainfall-dependent sources. To understand whether information on the ENSO state could help mitigate the effects of droughts, we use Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s water supply system as exemplifying case study, for which we design “traditional” and adaptive management policies.</description>

      <title>A Linear Dynamical Systems Approach to Streamflow Reconstruction Reveals History of Regime Shifts in Northern Thailand
</title>

      <description>Streamflow reconstruction involves estimating streamflow volumes in the distant past using statistical techniques and long range climate proxies. Conventionally, this is done using linear regression techniques which model streamflow as a linear function of climatic inputs. These models do not consider catchment dynamics, although in reality, streamflow volume depends on both climatic inputs and the state of the catchment (whether it is wet or dry). Here, we contribute a novel reconstruction technique, based on linear dynamical systems, that models explicitly the catchment state and its interaction with climatic inputs.</description>
