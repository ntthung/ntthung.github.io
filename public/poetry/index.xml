      <description>Should we have the blue
For temperatures, volcanoes,
Teleconnections
And hydroclimate too?
Higher temperature, denser wood
I thought this was understood
But wait, it may be diverging
And challenge our understanding.
And there in the tropics
Warm often and seasonally humid
To see all the control factors
You may add hydro to the mix.
Tambora erupted
A decade the blue interrupted.
Should we have the blue?
I think so, do you?</description>

      <title>It&#39;s the dams</title>

      <description>The Mekong is mighty, the Mekong is dammed
The Mekong is flooded in the dry season
Is it by nature, or is it caused by dams?
“It’s the dams!”, said the trees
“For I haven’t seen anything like that
In almost three centuries”.
“It’s true!”, said the model
“For what you see is not natural
It’s a half time more than normal”.
The cycle has changed
The delicate balance hangs</description>

      <title>Water in everything</title>

      <description>Water for food
Water for energy
Energy for food
It’s all a nexus.
Water in our meat
Water in our shoes
In everything we eat
In everything we use.
“ON” a light we turn
Water is there too.
Our water footprint?
How big? We can choose.</description>

      <title>Give your lawn mower a break</title>

      <description>Roses are red
Violets are blue
The tree rings say
Megadroughts are staring at you
Temperatures run high
The soil runs dry
ENSO in full swing
Drought? Not a blink.
Save water
Fix the leaks
Give your lawn mower
A break</description>

      <title>The flow of nature</title>

      <description>What goes up must come down
What comes down may flow out
Overland,
Subsurface,
And seepage
To rivers all around.
Let the rain infiltrate.
An impervious surface
Is an open flood gate
Like soil after drought
Forests doused with flames.
Rivers are too warm
Waters are too rich
Oxygen devoured.
The flow of water
The flow of nature
Let our water flow
Let our nature grow.</description>

      <description>The water cycle:
River, oceans, mountains, clouds
Soil, ice, air, plants, animals
And humans too.</description>

      <title>A stronger water cycle</title>

      <description>Such devastation
When the rivers swell
And land inundated
Will this be our fate
Mighty trees, do tell!
(And the trees answered)
Floods you must worry
But lest you forget
Droughts are getting worse
In four centuries.
A stronger water cycle
Could mean more troubles:
Frequent floods and droughts!
More tree ring records
Less water hurdle.</description>

      <title>Forest and water</title>

      <description>Forest, forest, what are thee?
I am part hydrology
Look around, it&amp;rsquo;s all water
Above, below, and within me.
I intercept water with my canopy
and with my litter of leaves.
I transpire as I photosynthesize
Less moisture recycled without me.
I carry rings that hold stories
Kept within my ancient trees.
I am your past and your future
So study me and protect me.</description>

      <title>Annual rings, monthly flows</title>

      <description>I am all for
Tree ring cores
One year, one number
How do we get more?
Take ring width and δ18O from some species
With different seasonal sensitivities
Combine them with mass balance regression
And we can have streamflow, monthly
(with long term intra-annual variability)
There are still challenges as we speak
The dry months, the wet years, the years with multiple peaks
But we have BI, and methods that are nonlinear</description>
