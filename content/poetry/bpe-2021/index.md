I am all for  
Tree ring cores  
One year, one number  
How do we get more?

Take ring width and &delta;<sup>18</sup>O from some species  
With different seasonal sensitivities  
Combine them with mass balance regression  
And we can have streamflow, monthly  
(with long term intra-annual variability)

There are still challenges as we speak  
The dry months, the wet years, the years with multiple peaks  
But we have BI, and methods that are nonlinear  
Better skills will come one day near

So what? Why do all of this?  
Well, so that water management decisions won't go amiss  
And when historians and paleoclimatologists sit together  
They can find a story that fits.
