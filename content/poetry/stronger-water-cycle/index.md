Such devastation  
When the rivers swell  
And land inundated  
Will this be our fate  
Mighty trees, do tell!

(And the trees answered)  
Floods you must worry  
But lest you forget  
Droughts are getting worse  
In four centuries.

A stronger water cycle  
Could mean more troubles:  
Frequent floods and droughts!  
More tree ring records  
Less water hurdle.
