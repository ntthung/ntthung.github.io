Should we have the blue  
For temperatures, volcanoes,  
Teleconnections  
And hydroclimate too?

Higher temperature, denser wood  
I thought this was understood  
But wait, it may be diverging  
And challenge our understanding.

And there in the tropics  
Warm often and seasonally humid  
To see all the control factors  
You may add hydro to the mix.

Tambora erupted  
A decade the blue interrupted.  
Should we have the blue?  
I think so, do you?
