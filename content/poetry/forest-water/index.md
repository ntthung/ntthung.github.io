Forest, forest, what are thee?  
I am part hydrology  
Look around, it's all water  
Above, below, and within me.


I intercept water with my canopy  
and with my litter of leaves.  
I transpire as I photosynthesize  
Less moisture recycled without me.


I carry rings that hold stories  
Kept within my ancient trees.  
I am your past and your future  
So study me and protect me.
