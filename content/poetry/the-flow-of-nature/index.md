What goes up must come down  
What comes down may flow out  
Overland,  
Subsurface,  
And seepage  
To rivers all around.

Let the rain infiltrate.  
An impervious surface  
Is an open flood gate  
Like soil after drought  
Forests doused with flames.

Rivers are too warm  
Waters are too rich  
Oxygen devoured.

The flow of water  
The flow of nature  
Let our water flow  
Let our nature grow.
