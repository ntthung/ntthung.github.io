The Mekong is mighty, the Mekong is dammed  
The Mekong is flooded in the dry season  
Is it by nature, or is it caused by dams?  

“It’s the dams!”, said the trees  
“For I haven’t seen anything like that  
In almost three centuries”.

“It’s true!”, said the model  
“For what you see is not natural  
It’s a half time more than normal”.

The cycle has changed  
The delicate balance hangs  
Wet forests linger  
Birds and fish wither.

Man versus river  
Power for growth or water for life?  
Let us care and find an answer  
Lest Mother River loses her might.
