## Students' testimonials

*He is an excellent professor who simplifies and effectively explains complex topics. His use of various 
teaching tools and passion for the subject, combined with his availability to assist students, greatly 
enhances the learning experience. I thoroughly enjoyed his class.*

*He has an infectious enthusiasm which spilled over into the class.*

*Hung Nguyen is an amazing teacher. So energetic, very knowledgeable on the subject, clearly loves the 
material and is generous in sharing his knowledge, incredibly dedicated to our learning, and is a very 
thoughtful and kind communicator. For example, before introducing the coding assignments to us, he 
prefaced it with a pep talk about having a growth mindset and also made it clear he would be there to help 
us if we didn't know how to code. The class field trip to Lamont was a real highlight.*

*Hung is more than a teaching associate - he was basically a second professor in the course. He is an excellent instructor - the way he was able to break down R for students with little to no background in the platform/language is a skill that few possess. He is patient and encouraging. He wants students to be as curious as he is and enables that curiosity so that the students walk away learning something new. I think he would be a phenomenal professo and I am so glad that he was as involved in this course as he was. He and Brendan make a truly great team.*

*Having Hung as the “TA” was like having a second professor in the course. Hung managed to take a class of total programming beginners and turn most of them into enthusiastic R amateurs. The evidence was that half of the final projects contained an R analysis done by student choice. Hung is an absolute R wizard but also understands the underlying climate dynamics, which makes for a powerful combination. The combination of understanding the data and the ability to use an efficient statistical tool to do an analysis of millions of data is an incredibly powerful tool to give to climate science students. Hung made himself available on short notice and patiently but efficiently taught students not just how to complete assignments, but how to approach climate data analysis. I also got to see Hung in action brilliantly defending his doctoral thesis and can say that whoever gets Hung on their faculty will be very lucky.*
