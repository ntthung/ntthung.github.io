  My research explores three interconnected themes:<br>
  **Hydrology and water resources**: changes in the water cycle across spatial and temporal scales, how those changes affect water resources, and how managment should adapt.  
  **Climate and society**: how past climatic changes affected societies, how societies reponded to such changes, and lessons for the future. I work closely with historians, archaeologists, and climate modelers.  
  **Tree rings**: although not a dendrochronologist by training, I fell in love with tree rings. Dendrochronology is now my main tool to reconstruct past climate and hydrology.
