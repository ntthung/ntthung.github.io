  Ultra-High Resolution Paleostreamflow for Southeast Asia: Proxy/Model Comparison

This project aims to develop high-resolution data sets of proxy-derived and model-derived paleostreamflow for Southeast Asia. 

We have submitted a proposal to the NSF P4CLIMATE program and results are pending.

More soon.
