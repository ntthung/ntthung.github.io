In this project, we aim to use stable isotope ratios (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O, &delta;<sup>13</sup>C, and &delta;<sup>15</sup>N) to reconstruct past climate and agriculture dynamics in Asia. We have submitted a proposal to the NSF DISES Program and results are pending.

We have also received USD 10,000 in seed funding from the Lamont-Doherty Climate Center.

More soon.
