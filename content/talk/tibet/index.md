  Panel discussionâ€”Indigenous knowledge systems and environmental management in Tibet and the Himalayas
excerpt: |
  In spring 2023, a pilot course is offered by the Modern Tibetan Studies Program A Climate History of the Tibetan Plateau. In this interdisciplinary course, students will learn from not only the conventional historical archives but also from natural archives tree rings. Possibly a first for a history class, students will also learn data analytics and use this newly acquired skill to explore the relationships between past climates and environmental histories in the Tibetan Plateau. <br> In this talk, I will present our new interdisciplinary teaching approach as well as some new results that our students discover during the course. I will discuss the challenges of teaching climate data analytics to a history class, and the opportunities our approach will bring to the field of climate and environmental history.
