description: My work explores the intimate feedback loop between the **water cycle** and **humanity**. I use *paleoclimate proxies* (mainly tree rings) as well as *climate and hydrological models* to study the water cycle---its behavior over space and time across scales, in the past, present, and future. Working with historians and archaeologists, I examine how societies were affected by, and adapted to, such changes. This knowledge of the past is key to help societies cope with climate change in the future. <br><br> Welcome to my website, where I share my stories and discoveries.
