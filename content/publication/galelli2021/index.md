excerpt: | 
  - Dendrohydrology dates back to Hardman and Reil (1936)---the first streamflow reconstruction from tree rings. Since then, streamflow records have been reconstructed worldwide, but streamflow reconstructions still see limited use in operational water management.
  
  - We point out the gaps between the dendrochronology and hydrology communities and suggest the way forward.
