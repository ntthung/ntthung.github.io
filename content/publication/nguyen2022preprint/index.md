excerpt: | 
  * The relationship between model skills for streamflow and evapotranspiration is explored using a stochastic approach

  * The value of remotely sensed evapotranspiration for streamflow estimation varies with regions, satellite products, and performance indices
  
  * The probability of having good model skill for streamflow does not always increase with increasing model skill for evapotranspiration
