Longleaf pines have not only long leaves, but also long lives. Thus they are excellent materials to build tree-ring time machines. Grant Hartley led a ginormous effort to review everything longleaf in this paper. I was lucky to contribute a teeny bit.

I also got to learn how such a big project is executed. In the old days this would have been a monograph by a gentleman scientist. Science is more inclusive now, and a diverse team of authors work on this project together.
